# is-today-monday

This simple NPM package helps you find out if today is Monday.

## Usage

To use this package, you will have to install it using `npm install is-today-monday`. Then you can use it fairly easily. You will have to require it as a function and then whenever you run the function it will return `true` (when today is Monday), or `false` (when today is not Monday).

```js
const is_today_monday = require('is-today-monday');
console.log(is_today_monday()); // Logs true if you run it on Monday, else it logs false
```
